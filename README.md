## Issues
During this implementation, I have some issues of trying to connect mosquitto with c, and node js directly through the code. I was successfully able to display the broker, subscriber, and publisher though the command prompt. I was able to see the code and messages through the Mqtt broker.

## Setup
1)First setup MQTT and mosquitto broker
2)Run MQTT and mosquitto broker through command prompt.
3)create code with c programming and any other language as a preference. 
4)Run code in terminal to make sure it is outputing.
5)Once done go to MQTT explorer to see if code has published successfully.
